<!--    About fragment-->

    <string name="aboutText">

        I started programming very late in my life.
        33 years old.
        But i quickly realized. this is what i want to do with
        my life.
        I have always had a passion for gaming, software,
        electronics and everything IT related.
        I spend the first 13 years of my working
        career as a mason. A decade later i finally
        realized that i software engineering was
        what i wanted to do.

        The rules for Hangman is as follows:\n\n

        - You need to guess the hidden word displayed by a number of \'*\'.\n
        - If you guess the word before the man is hanged, you win!\n
        - If you guess wrong 7 times, (the man is fully displayed in the noose,\n
          and a final wrong answer will kill him) then you loose the game.\n\n
        - Each time you win, you will go up a point in the highscore list. \n

        If you press \'New game!\'. the game will reset and you can try again.\n\n
        Good luck convict!
