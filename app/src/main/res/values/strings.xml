    <string name="aboutText">

        I started programming very late in my life.
        33 years old.
        But i quickly realized. this is what i want to do with
        my life.
        I have always had a passion for gaming, software,
        electronics and everything IT related.
        I spend the first 13 years of my working
        career as a mason. A decade later i finally
        realized that i software engineering was
        what i wanted to do.
